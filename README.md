# Migratooor

Migratooor transfers all your tokens from one wallet to another.

## Why would I want to do that?

if your wallet...
1. is compromised, or
2. is linked to your identity

...then you will want to move all your tokens to a new, fresh wallet.

## How does it work?

First your wallet is scanned to find your tokens. A table will be shown displaying your balance of each token. You can then (un)check each token to move. Migratooor will transfer each token, and all you need to do is confirm one transaction (and one transaction only).

## Does this reduce the number of transactions needed?

It does not. Unless you use a smart contract wallet, there is no way to reduce the number of transactions. This app simply makes the process less tedious.
